# hpc
Training material and tools for University of Sydney HPC use.

Main goal: develop working examples that assist hpc use with advanced python techniques,
using modern libraries and techniques.


1. Using simple functions (calculation of pi) in parallel manner using python multiprocessing
2. Intermediate scaling (mpi4py, numba) - (to do).
3. Working with large data and functions (dask bag)
4. Simulation and Visualisation cases (pangeo, dask etc)
